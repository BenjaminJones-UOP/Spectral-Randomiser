# Spectral-Randomiser
A new way at looking how to randomise audio. Uses the Fourier transfom function to find points of interest in audio. Currently only in it's concept stage. Made using Projucer's JUCE audio library. 

Please refer to the poster to understand how the application works and what it set out to do.

Please be aware that this project is part of a larger ambitious project that is to be worked on in the future and as such, it is currently
not in a working state but the programming foundations are there.
